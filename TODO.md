# TODO - User Photo in Navigation Bar

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyze user photo implementation in navbar.ejs
- [x] Update navbar.ejs to display user photo with fallback to default image
- [x] Add CSS to make the photo circular and consistent across all pages
- [x] Ensure the photo is properly styled and positioned in the navbar

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test the navigation bar in the browser to verify the photo displays correctly and is circular
- [ ] Verify that the default image loads when no user photo is set
- [ ] Check for any layout or styling issues on different screen sizes

## Notes
- The change uses EJS templating to set the image src dynamically
- Default image path: `/imagem/normal_u3.png`
- CSS added to `menu.css` for consistency across all pages
- Photo is now circular with border and proper sizing
